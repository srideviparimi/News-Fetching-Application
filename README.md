The main purpose of the application is to fetch data from an API.
Here I have used async/await principles for fetching the news from News API.
This application has a home page and a search page.
 Home Page:
   It consists of different categories of news and click on each article to watch the full article
Search Page:
  When we search something using the searchbar, It navigates to the articles that are related to search.
  Upon selecting the particular article, it navigates you to the full article.
  NOte: Search for "Teachnology" to see the related articles.
  

"Note: Since the NewsAPI is paid for Production, I have hard-coded the articles into my code. But the actual code is in the comments"
